title: "Aggregation"
---

When viewing a list of entries of a library, one can see, at the bottom of the list, the total number of entries listed. Also, when using the Group option to group the list by the values in a certain field, one can see a subtotal of the entries within that group within the list.

With *aggregation*, one can add other information into these locations. Specifically, one can perform any of four functions -- sum, min, max, and average -- on a library field, provide a prefix to be displayed (or not), and indicate the positioning of the result, and have it displayed together with the number of entries.
