title: "Field Role"
---

An important parameter for many fields is: *Display in the list as*.
This parameter determines the **role** the value of this field will play in the display of the list of library entries.

When you open a library, you see the list of its entries; the display of each entry consists of three areas, or *roles*:

| 4.Thumbnail | 1.Name
2.Description | 3.Status |
| --- | --- | --- |

The values of fields with the role of *Entry Name* are displayed in 1.

The values of fields with the role of *Entry Description* are displayed in 2.

The values of fields with the role of *Entry Status* are displayed in 3.

The values of fields with the role of *Thumbnail* are displayed in 4. The Thumbnail role is only for fields of type "Image".

The values of fields with the role of *Regular field* have no role in the display of the entries list, and you can see them only on the entry cards.
