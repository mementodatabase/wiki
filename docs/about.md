# About the Memento Database Wiki

## History

The Memento Database Wiki was created by the developers of Memento as an official documentation resource for the app. Over time, community members took an active role in expanding and improving its content.

**Bill Crews** became one of the most significant contributors — rewriting existing articles, adding new ones, and systematically covering field types, the user interface, and scripting. What started as developer documentation gradually evolved into a community-maintained knowledge base, largely thanks to his efforts.

## Contributors

A big thank you to everyone who contributed to this wiki over the years — especially **Bill Crews**, **Beth Dixon**, and **Ernst Moser**, whose time and dedication made it a valuable resource for the Memento community.
