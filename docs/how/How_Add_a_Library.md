---

To add a new library:
**Press the Add Library button** — Open the menu in the **[Libraries List screen](../ui/Libraries_List_screen.md)** and select *Add library*.There is no floating Add  (**+**) button on this screen in the current version.
**Determine starting point** — If you want to use or start work from a template, you may select one. You can use a template already structured with fields, or you can select the *Empty library* template and create all library fields yourself. Also you can select a template from the online catalog. You can edit and customize the ready templates as well as the Empty library template.
**Structure your new library** — After you select the template, you will see they **[Library Edit screen](../ui/Library_Edit_screen.md)**, where you can begin to structure your library with fields, pages, aggregations, autofill rules, etc. The new library already contains the set of fields from the selected template, if any.

### Online catalog of library templates
You can create libraries using templates that other users have uploaded to the online catalog. For that purpose, when creating a library, on the template list select *From online catalog*.

If you would like to share your template with friends, you can publish it in the online catalog. For that purpose, open the library editor screen and then click on the *Share* menu item.
