title: "Signature field"
---

A Signature field may contain a link to the stored image of a signature.

The Free Mobile Edition allows for one signature to be stored. The Pro Mobile Edition allows an unlimited number of signatures to be stored.

When importing and exporting, the full pathname to the signature image file is used.

The signature image is not stored in the database. If files have been moved to another location, you can automatically change the links: library > right slide menu > files> menu > find missing files.

You can set the directory for files : settings > file storage.

## Advanced Parameters
**Paint options** — Because the signature is captured within the application, these options describe the height & width of the paint box, the brush size & color and the background color to be used for capture & display.
