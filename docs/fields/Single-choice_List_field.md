title: "Single-choice List field"
---

A Single-choice List library field is an ordered set of text strings from which a user might select one. A Single-choice List entry field contains either an empty string or a string value chosen from this list.

The value of a Single-choice List field may be used as a dependency to determine visibility of other fields during entry creation and edit.

During import or sync with Google, if a value is found that is not in the list, it will be created.

During import, export, or sync with Google Sheets, the list is externalized by concatenation using a comma separator (", ").

## Advanced Parameters
**Where you can edit** — Unlike most field types, Single-choice List fields can be displayed and edited (changed, checked/unchecked) in the list directly, though by default, a field will be displayed in the Entry View and Entry Edit cards and may be edited in the Entry Edit Card.
