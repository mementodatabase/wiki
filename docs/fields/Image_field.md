title: "Image field"
---

An Image field may contain a link to a stored image.

The Free Mobile Edition allows for one image to be stored. The Pro Mobile Edition allows an unlimited number of images to be stored.

When importing and exporting, the full pathname to the image is used.

The image is not stored in the database. If images have been moved to another location, you can automatically change the links: library > right slide menu > files> menu > find missing files.

You can set the directory for files : settings > file storage.
