1. Desktop Edition
A Tags field holds a set of values. A Tag is a word, so to express multiple words as a tag, one needs to defuse a plan where spaces delineate the words, but rather some other character like an underscore (_) or hyphen (-) can indicate a division among words. This example, "black swan" could be rendered as "black_swan" or "black-swan" (without the quotes). Some might use capitalization, like "blackSwan".

## Properties
**Hint** — Same as in the [Mobile Edition](#Mobile_Edition)

**Default value** — Same as in the [Mobile Edition](#Mobile_Edition)

**Required** — Same as in the [Mobile Edition](#Mobile_Edition)

**Unique** — Selecting this option ensures that a tag entry will be unique. Can only be set in the Desktop edition.
