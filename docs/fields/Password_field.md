title: "Password field"
---

A Password field may contain any textual data. It is stored in UTF-8, a standard 8-bit Unicode format.

During entry and display of a password value, asterisks are displayed instead of the password's actual value. The actual value is displayed only on the Entry View and Entry Edit cards when the user touches or clicks on the asterisks in the field.
