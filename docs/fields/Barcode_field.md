A Barcode (BAR) field may contain any textual data. It is stored in UTF-8, a standard 8-bit Unicode format.

A camera icon, to the right of the text entry blank, may be pressed to use the device's camera to scan the code. The code image will be stored on the device.

When viewing an entry, the Barcode field may be pressed, which displays the code and may be shared at that point.

You can search for entries by this field after scanning.
