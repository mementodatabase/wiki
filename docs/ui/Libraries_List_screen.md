---

The Libraries List screen has the following parts:

## The Libraries List
The Libraries list can be viewed as larger or smaller tiles or as icons. The view to be used can be selected in the [*Action Menu*](#The Action Menu).

The Libraries in the current library group is displayed. The Group can be selected by panning left or right or by selecting the group from the [*Group/Main Menu*](#The Group/Main Menu).

### Library Tiles & Icons
Touching an icon or tile opens the library. Each tile has a [*Library Menu*](#The Library Menu) and possibly also an Add Entry Menu.

Icons or tiles may be moved (reordered) within the group by dragging.

## The Action Menu
Touching the **3-dot icon in the upper-right corner of the screen** opens the Action Menu, allowing the user to perform one of the following actions:

**Add Library** — Opens the **[Library Edit screen](Library_Edit_screen.md)** for a new library in the current group

**Add Group** — Accepts the name of a new group and adds a new group with that name

**Open by URL** — Accepts a library name at http://libs.mobi/ and opens that library

**Rename Group** — Presents the name of the current group, allowing the user to alter that name, and accepts the new name as the name of the current group

**View** — Allows selection of the desired Library List view. The available views are: Large Tile view, Small Tile view, and Icons view

## The Group/Main Menu
Touching the **3-line menu in the upper-left corner of the screen** opens the Group/Main Menu, which allows selection of the Group to be displayed. The developer occasionally refers to this menu as the **slide menu**. Some people like to call the 3-line icon a **hamburger icon** and thus the menu as the **hamburger menu**.

Below the list of groups, the following menu items are displayed:
**Favorites** — Show an Entries list of entries marked as Favorites across all libraries
**History** — Show an Entries list of entries across all libraries updated in History
**Recycle Bin** — Show a Libraries list of the Recycle Bin
