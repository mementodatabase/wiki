The Library Settings screen provides settings for a library.

## Data Operations
### Clearing the Library
The user is prompted as to whether really to delete all library entries. If the user presses the **Yes** button, all entries are sent to the Recycle Bin.

## Google Sheets
### Synchronizing Files
The user may choose a cloud service to use for Google Sheets synchronization. By default, synchronization is not performed. If a sync link is initiated, then by default, Google Drive is used, if it is available. So, this is where non-default action should be specified.

### Related Libraries
Set this switch on to synchronize related libraries prior to this one.

### Unlink from Google Sheets
Press the **Unlink from Google Sheets** button to sever the Library's link to Google Sheets.

## Security
### Remove Protection
If the library is **[protected](Library_Protection.md)**, this option is enabled to allow the user to remove the protection.

### Lock Structure
Set this option On to permit the changing of library structure.

## Edit
### Edit Mode
Set this option On to go into the **[Entry Edit card](Entry_Edit_card.md)** When an entry is trapped, instead of the **[Entry View card](Entry_View_card.md)**.
