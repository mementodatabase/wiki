A formatting template specifies, for each field in the library, how the field value should be formatted for the outside source or destination.

The Formatting Templates screen contains:

**In the upper-left corner of the screen** — an left-arrow button to exit the screen

**In the Title Bar,** — The Library name and the formatting function

**In the upper-right corner of the screen,** — a plus (**+**) icon to Add a template

**The name of the current formatting template** — default or other

**The name of a field in the library** — with a drop-down list to select other fields

**Formatting options for the field** — on/off switches, on by default

**Send field** — : or don't

...and if so...

; Start a new line: or not

; Include the field name: or not

...and if so...

; Include a colon after the field name: or don't

The user may adjust these settings field by field, one by one.
