#### *Data Analysis* in the *Desktop edition* (aka Slicing & dicing)
Sorting, grouping, filtering, charting, aggregation

Memento provides the ability to view entries in the Entries List as a straightforward list of entries. In addition, it provides an assortment of list features the user can use:
- to *sort* or view the entries in various orders (sequences),
- to *filter* the data to see only the entries you want to see, view entries in groups with subtotals,
- to *chart* or view the entries' field values plotted on a chart to give the user a visual image of how the data values relate to each other,
- and to *aggregate* or view totals & subtotals, averages, minimums, or maximums.
