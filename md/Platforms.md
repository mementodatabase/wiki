Memento is currently available in two editions: The Mobile Edition and the  Desktop Edition. The Mobile Edition runs on Android devices and on Apple iOS devices, like iPhones & iPads, while the Desktop Edition runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple Macintosh.

The editions are generally functionally equivalent, with the features of the Desktop Edition coming up to speed with those of the Mobile Edition, with that work prioritized based on demand from the user community. (So, continue to express your features of interest at http://memento.UserVoice.com to influence those priorities.)

   1. The Mobile Edition
The Mobile Edition was initially developed for Android devices (primarily smartphones and tablets), and Memento development for the Android platform actively continues. Memento for the iOS platform was introduced more recently and is still catching up to the Android platform in capability.

The basic Mobile Edition is free. For a small one-time fee, one can obtain a license for *Memento Pro*, which enables the following:
- Unlimited synchronization with Google Sheets
- Unlimited library protection
- Unlimited charting
- Backup of files with libraries
- An app widget

You can get that license at http://MementoDatabase.com/#pro.

   1. The Desktop Edition
After a beta period, the Desktop Edition is now released, and development is actively proceeding.

      1. Downloading the Desktop Edition

The Windows installation files include the version of Java that is needed. The jar file contains only Memento and relies on the Java implementation installed on the platform.

   1. Synchronizing across devices and platforms
Synchronization of Memento databases across desktop and mobile platforms is performed through [the Memento Cloud](Cloud storage and Teamwork.md).
