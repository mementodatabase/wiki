title: "Category:En"

This is the English (En) category of the Memento Wiki. It should probably be the Lang-en category, but En is the way Bill did it, and now too many pages would have to be edited to change it, so it is En (until/unless **somebody other than Bill** decides to expend the effort to change it.

These pages constitute the English language version of the Memento Database Wiki. As of 2022-03-15, I have also created a Lang.de category. Let the En category be the exception (until/unless it is changed to Lang.en by someone other than Bill), with the rest all being Lang.xx, where xx represents the language to be added.

**How language categories are used**
The expectation is that such categories will uniquely identify the language being used. That might help a reader visually, but it might serve in the future as a key to use in a script to accomplish something to the entire wiki of a language, such as to cut it, copy it, delete it, or edit it in some way -- probably in a way that is language-specific.
