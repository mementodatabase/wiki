**This wiki** is a living document (or set of documents) and as such is **always** under development and is nevertheless **always working**; we are always doing the best we can  with what we've got and making the most of it. If we know we need information, though we don't have it or haven't written it yet, it will just stop, with [red links](red links.md) indicating pages yet to be written. You may also encounter pages that display an **"UNDER DEVELOPMENT"** note. We recommend you wait (from a few days to a few months, and (to be honest) occasionally a few years until the message goes away before reading, as it will likely be erroneous.

While most aspects of Memento are common between the Mobile and Desktop editions, this wiki (generally) contains only information about the Mobile edition of Memento. Each page shows at the top of the page the version of the Mobile edition current as of the most recent change to the page. It also shows the version number of the Desktop edition current as of that date. Note the Help accessible within the app and from Help on the MementoDatabase.com Web site. Memento Help contains assistance for both the Mobile and Desktop editions.

An index to the pages of the wiki may be accessed via the following Index in the form of a table containing links to Wiki pages grouped vertically by topic and horizontally by the columns of Overviews, Specifications, Techniques, Tips, How, & Tutorials. Use the Index & wiki links throughout the wiki to navigate around among the pages of the wiki.

      1. Where do I start with Memento?

   1. The Memento Database Desktop Edition
***Please be aware that this section is currently under development.***

Core functions of Memento Database are available not only from the mobile app but from the Desktop Edition for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.  The libraries created in Desktop Edition are synced via Memento Cloud and so are available on all devices you use.

      1. Memento Database YouTube Channel
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNCXfD6ABC596q84dwbgQ3Q

      1. Introduction
The Memento Database Desktop edition is a perfect complement to the Mobile edition.  I started with the mobile app and have never looked back.  With now over 25 libraries created I can store, manipulate, and manage my personal and small business data in real time, by using either edition.

This section is dedicated to the Desktop edition; however, when appropriate we will identify Desktop features that are different and/or not available in the Mobile edition.

      1. Desktop Edition Welcome Page
Once you launch Memento Database Desktop, you get access to all libraries created from your account and the ones shared with you.

The Welcome page helps you choose where to start:  
**New Library**- create a new Library from scratch and adjust each and every field manually.  
**Recent**- manage libraries already created
**Help** - find answers to your questions on "Getting Started, Setting up Libraries, Working with data, Reports, Teamwork.

      1. Main window interface
All features of Memento Database Desktop version are available from the main window.  It consists of these logical parts:
**Title bar** - located at the top of the window.  Your version of Memento Database and user name is displayed on the left.  To the right you will find the familiar minimize, maximize, and close buttons
**Menu bar** - appears as text directly below the Title bar.  Here one can choose “File”, “Account”, and “Help”.  Selecting one of these items presents an additional drop down menu of additional commands and information.
**Sidebar** - appears on the left side of the screen.  Here one can navigate through the My libraries folder and the Shared with me folder.  Perform a search for entries in a specific library and/or all libraries.  Perform a search and download a Catalog template.
**Status bar** - located in the bottom left corner of the screen shows the notifications about Memento Database cloud usage.  For example 127 MB (0%) of 20GB.
**Workspace** -  the workspace is all the area inside the window to the right of the Sidebar.  The workspace changes depending on your selection in the Sidebar.

      1. Customizing the window interface
There are two options to customize Memento’s window interface.  Bootstrap theme or Classic theme.  To choose your theme, select “Help” from the Menu bar, scroll down to “Theme”.
**Classic Theme**

   1. Other assistance
Unlike before the wiki, nowadays the Memento app has some Help within the app, developed by LuckyDroid. You can access it right next to where you access the wiki. The Help is oriented less for Power Users than the wiki and more for general users and beginners.

   1. Previous, obsolete documentation (erroneous & misleading)
''Previous Memento documentation has been subsumed within the wiki. It is listed here for reference, but its content has not been updated in quite a while and is not likely to be updated going forward.

Its content is now obsolete.
