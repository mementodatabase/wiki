1. An ***application*** for the creation & use of [*a database*](About:Glossary#D.md) on your phone, tablet, or desktop computer
Memento Database enables its users to create & then use a database supporting a process to meet an objective. Each database can be composed of one or more [*libraries*](About:Glossary#L.md) each containing information about a *subject*. Libraries are very often called *tables* in common database parlance. Another similar tool is a spreadsheet, with rows & columns, though Memento databases are much more powerful and often easy to use as compared with spreadsheets.

A library allows information about the subject to be stored as [*fields*](About:Glossary#F.md). In a table, a field might be shown as a *column* with a column name. Likewise, a library's fields have names, such as *Product name*, *Purchase date*, or *Sales price*.

Each row of a spreadsheet or record in a table corresponds to an [*entry*](About:Glossary#E.md) in a Memento library. A library's entries may be displayed as a list in [List view*](About:Glossary#L.md) or as rows of a grid in Memento's [*Table view*](About:Glossary#T.md) or as cards in [*Cards view*](About:Glossary#C.md), and there are other views as well. See [*Library views''](About:LibraryViews.md) and [the Memento Database glossary](About:Glossary.md) for more information.
