The following tips have been suggested regarding file attachments.

**From Roberto dal Maso, 2016-12-26, release 4.1.0** — For a time, it was necessary to rename .xls and .xlsx files to another extension, like .pdf, to get them to sync, due to a bug on the server. This bug has been fixed (no need to update clients). Now it's once again possible to attach any type of file, and it'll be synced; the issue now is that if you modify an attached file, it's not updated in the cloud, but only locally.
