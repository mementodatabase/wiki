title: "Library Protection"
---

Libraries may be protected using password protection and may be encrypted using AES-128.
A **single master password** is used for restricting the access to libraries.

To protect a library:
1. Open the Library menu and select ***Protection***.
1. If you haven’t set up a master password yet, you’ll be prompted to enter one.
1. Enable/disable library encryption and click on the **OK** button.

Now, when opening a protected library, you will have to enter the master password (if it wasn’t entered yet).

      1. Please note
- In an encrypted library, only string fields of the entries are encrypted.
- If you forget your master password, it will be impossible to recover it, and you will not be able to decrypt your data.
- If the Memento application is unused for 5 minutes, the access to all protected libraries will be closed automatically. 
- To reopen the access, you’ll have to reenter the master password.
