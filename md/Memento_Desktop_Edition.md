title: "Memento Desktop Edition"
---

The Desktop Edition of Memento Database was developed after the Mobile Edition and is available as a Java JAR file and can be installed wherever Java is installed. In addition, the Desktop Edition can be installed bundled together with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) on Microsoft Windows platforms as a Windows install file. The Desktop Edition is tested and supported on Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, and Linux platforms.

Certain functions cannot be carried out unless the device is a phone, like SMS messaging or call initiation. Location fields are in part dependent upon the presence of a GPS.

App integration depends upon the platform and the apps that are on it. **[Tasker integration](Tasker Integration.md)**, for instance, is specific to the Mobile Edition.

For release history, see **[Releases](Releases.md)**.
