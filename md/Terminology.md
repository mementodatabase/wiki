Over the years and continuing today, various database technologies and tools have employed/employ distinct nomenclature. In the table below, that of Memento is shown with other leading terminology.

| **Memento** | **Relational DBMS** | **Spreadsheet** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Database | Database | Directory |
| Library | Table | Sheet or Table |
| Field | Column (or Domain or Field) | Column |
| Entry | Row (or Record) | Row |
| Link To Entry | Foreign key | Hyperlink |

      1. Databases
Memento is a database product, and a user's Memento libraries, together with associated files &mdash; including photos, barcodes, and so on &mdash; constitute the user's overall Memento database. However, this is NOT a carefully defined term. One could consider the set of libraries within a Group to be a database; or perhaps each set of libraries that are linked together to formulate a solution, aggregated or otherwise. So, *database* remains a general term.

      1. Groups
The set of all libraries in a database can be subdivided into *Groups*. Groups simplify lists of libraries. They are merely containers; there is no Group functionality.

      1. Pages
The initial set of fields for a library is on a tab called MAIN; this is the name of a *Page*. The user can add more pages; each will have a name and a tab; and each will have its own set of fields. Each entry in a library contains all fields across all pages.
