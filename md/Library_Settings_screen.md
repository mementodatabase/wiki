The Library Settings screen provides settings for a library.

   1. Data Operations
      1. Clearing the Library
The user is prompted as to whether really to delete all library entries. If the user presses the **Yes** button, all entries are sent to the Recycle Bin.

   1. Google Sheets
      1. Synchronizing Files
The user may choose a cloud service to use for Google Sheets synchronization. By default, synchronization is not performed. If a sync link is initiated, then by default, Google Drive is used, if it is available. So, this is where non-default action should be specified.

      1. Related Libraries
Set this switch on to synchronize related libraries prior to this one.

      1. Unlink from Google Sheets
Press the **Unlink from Google Sheets** button to sever the Library's link to Google Sheets.

   1. Security
      1. Remove Protection
If the library is **[protected](Library Protection.md)**, this option is enabled to allow the user to remove the protection.

      1. Lock Structure
Set this option On to permit the changing of library structure.

   1. Edit
      1. Edit Mode
Set this option On to go into the **[Entry Edit card](Entry Edit card.md)** When an entry is trapped, instead of the **[Entry View card](Entry View card.md)**.
