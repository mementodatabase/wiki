1. Wiki Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of the Memento Database wiki!

   1. Focus
The Memento wiki is *directed toward the Memento user* whether proficient in JavaScript or educated in database design or not.

While interesting content, maybe of general educational or historical value, may be important to understand, these topics should *not get in the way of wiki users who* might not have much time to spend gathering information because of their *need to get things done promptly in their business or other pursuit.* The wiki is first & foremost a reference tool, so quick & effective access to specific information is paramount. Sections of narrative value should be placed to the side, but it is important that it be clear as to what & where it is so users can access it when they have time.

Our primary objective is one of balance: between desktop & mobile editions, between bottom-up & top-down link structure, between simplicity & complexity, etc.

There are topics that are not covered out maybe not even mentioned in the wiki only because there hasn't been apparent need for or interest in these topics, which include the JasperSoft report writer, the Private Server, & the Memento Java (*not JavaScript!*) API.

   1. History
When the original wiki author, Bill Crews, first began using the only edition at that time, the mobile edition, Memento was at release 3.7.0, and the documentation consisted of 2 documents -- the Manual and the FAQ, both of which were extremely sparse and worse -- out of date. There were 14 field types at that time.

This documentation started to be developed in April of 2021. It is being developed by both Bill Crews and Beth Dixon. It presents information equally between the Mobile & Desktop editions. common between the Mobile and Desktop editions.

   1. Memento Wiki documentation
This documentation is always under development. Expect links to pages yet to be developed, which are shown as [red links](red links.md). You may also encounter pages that display an **"UNDER DEVELOPMENT"** message at the top. We recommend you wait until the message goes away before reading, as it might be erroneous or misleading.

Each page shows at the top of the page the version of the Mobile edition current as of the most recent change to the page. It also shows the version number of the Desktop edition current as of that date. Note the Help accessible within the app and from Help on the MementoDatabase.com Web site. Memento Help contains assistance for both the Mobile and Desktop editions.

An index to the pages of the documentation may be accessed via the following Documentation Index in the form of a table containing links to wiki pages grouped vertically by topic and horizontally by the columns of Overviews, Specifications, Techniques, Tips, How, & Tutorials. Use the Index & wiki links throughout the wiki to navigate around among the pages of the documentation.
