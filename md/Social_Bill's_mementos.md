1. Bill's mementos

***Articles on the use & programming of Memento***

Bill's mementos are sometimes weekly, sometimes monthly forum postings published within the Memento wiki. They are being started by Bill Crews, with support from Beth Dixon, initially focused on areas Bill knows best that others may generally know less about, to provide the most benefit before losing Bill as a resource.

| **Questions** | **Answers** |
| --- | --- |
| **What are Bill's mementos?** | Articles on the use of Memento & JavaScript published periodically by Bill Crews, Memento user & originator of the Memento wiki. Many of the mementos introduce & link to a tutorial located in the wiki. |
| **How do Bill's mementos work?** | When a new memento is ready for publication, the associated tutorial, if any, will be inserted into the wiki. Then the article (or introduction, if there is a tutorial) will be posted in the forum. The mementos will be numbered and dated. A record of them will (probably) also be recorded in the wiki. |

Since this memento references a tutorial, these paragraphs will be an introduction for it, setting context for it, giving the objectives, approach, etc.

See [Bill's tutorial #2.3](Social:Bill's_tutorial_#2.3.md): How to use a library to supply Autofill data for another library.
