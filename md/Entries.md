An Entry is a structured and finalized item of data. It may be also called a record (in terms of databases) or a row (in terms of tables). All data in the Library consists of entries. Each entry has several predefined fields. Also, you can add a comment to each entry while creating or editing it.

By default, the list of entries is sorted by the creation time, but you can sort, group and filter data as you wish. In addition, you can add entries to favorites, move them to the recycle bin or remove permanently.

Entries can be added or edited manually, imported or exported. All data stored in entries is synced through the devices where you are logged in.
