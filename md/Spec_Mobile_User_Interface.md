**The [Libraries List screen](Libraries List screen.md)** — Shows a list of libraries within the current group. It is the initial screen shown when Memento is started.

**The [Library Edit screen](Library Edit screen.md)** — Shows the structure of a library, its fields, pages, relationships, aggregations, and autofill rules. Allows add or edit of library structure. It is most often initiated from either the **[Libraries List screen](Libraries List screen.md)** or the **[Library Entries List screen](Library Entries List screen.md)**.

**The [Library Entries List screen](Library Entries List screen.md)** — Shows the entries within the current library. It is most often initiated by opening a library, generally from the **[Libraries List screen](Libraries List screen.md)**.

**The [Entry View card](Entry View card.md)** — Shows the fields within the current page of the current entry, with tabs for the other pages. It is generally initiated from an entries list screen, most often from the **[Library Entries List screen](Library Entries List screen.md)**.

**The [Entry Edit card](Entry Edit card.md)** — Shows the fields of the current page of the current entry prepared for editing, with tabs for the other pages. It is generally initiated from either an entries list screen or from the **[Entry View card](Entry View card.md)**.

      1. Other screens and cards
#### Lists of entries
There are other lists of entries besides the main **[Library Entries List screen](Library Entries List screen.md)**.

**The Library History screen** — Lists entries of the library that have been recently changed. Each entry in the list is shown with its Entry Name concatenation and how long ago it was last changed. It works like a special filter and can be called up from the **[Library Entries List screen](Library Entries List screen.md)**.

**The Favorite Entries List screen** — Lists entries of the library that have been marked as Favorites. Each entry in the list shows its Entry Name concatenation. It works like a special filter and can be called up from the **[Library Entries List screen](Library Entries List screen.md)**.

**The Recycle Bin screen** — Lists entries once in the library and now in the **Recycle Bin**. Each entry in the list shows its Entry Name concatenation and the date TBD entry was deleted. It works like a special filter and can be called up from the **[Library Entries List screen](Library Entries List screen.md)**.

#### Other lists
**The Charts List screen** — The **[Charts List screen](Charts List screen.md)** shows a list of previously-defined charts and allows edit, deletion, and the adding of new ones.

**The Attached Files card** — **[Attached Files card](Attached Files card.md)**
