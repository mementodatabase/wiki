1. Bill's mementos
***Newsletters with articles on the use & programming of Memento***

*Bill's mementos* are sometimes monthly, sometimes quarterly forum postings published in the Memento Forum and archived within the Memento wiki. They are published by Bill Crews, initially focused on areas Bill knows best that others may generally know less about, to provide the most benefit before losing Bill as a resource.

After a brief introduction, each *Memento*will contain 1-3 articles that are usually in the forum off a primer chapter -- initially a primer for JavaScript programming and one for using JavaScript to script Memento Database. In the future I hope to begin to offer articles on database design and other useful background information.

      1. FAQ
| **Questions** | **Answers** |
| --- | --- |
| **What are Bill's mementos?** | Articles on the use of Memento & JavaScript published periodically by Bill Crews, Memento user & originator of the Memento wiki. Many of the mementos introduce & link to a tutorial located in the wiki. |
| **How do Bill's mementos work?** | When a new memento is ready for publication, the associated tutorial, if any, will be inserted into the wiki. Then the article (or introduction, if there is a tutorial) will be posted in the forum. The mementos will be numbered and dated. A record of them will (probably) also be recorded in the wiki. |
| '''What do mementos look like? | **Bill's memento #10, Jun 29 2021** |

If this memento contains no reference to a tutorial, the memento will basically be a set of paragraphs, set off as appropriate by headings. The article may include lists, tables, & possibly images, like a magazine article would.

**Bill's memento #11, Jun 30 2021. Tutorial 2.3: How to use a library to supply Autofill data for another library**

Since this memento references a tutorial, these paragraphs will be an introduction for it, setting context for it, giving the objectives, approach, etc.

See [Bill's tutorial #2.3](Bill's tutorial #2.3.md): How to use a library to supply Autofill data for another library.
