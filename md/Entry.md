title: "Entry"
---

An entry is an instance of the library's data. An entry is identified by the fields in the library with the [role](Field Role.md) of Entry Name. If multiple fields have this role, these fields are concatenated, delimited by spaces, to arrive at the identifier, as it is displayed in the user interface.

Entries are by default listed in the order they were created, so to sort by the Entry Name fields or in other ways, use the right-side menu to sort them and/or to group them or to filter them.
