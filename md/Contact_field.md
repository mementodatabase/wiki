A Contact field may contain a link to a contact in the local mobile Contacts / Address book application. The contact's name and phone number may be referenced using this link.

When the field value is pressed while in the Entry View card, the device's default contact app is launched to display the contact.

The link may be to one or more contacts.

When a contact is deleted from the address book, the link to it will be lost.

Contact fields may not be imported.
