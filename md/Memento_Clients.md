The Memento standalone/client application is offered in two editions: the Mobile Edition and the Desktop Edition.

**The [Memento Mobile Edition](Memento Mobile Edition.md)** — The Mobile Edition was developed first and is available only for Google Android platforms. It is available for installation in the Google Play Store.

**The [Memento Desktop Edition](Memento Desktop Edition.md)** — The Desktop Edition was developed beginning in 2016 and runs as a Java application. It has been tested for some Linux, Apple Macintosh, and Microsoft Windows releases. It can be downloaded and installed from **[the Memento Web site](https://mementodatabase.com/#desktop)**.

Users with accounts may choose to join the Beta Testing program. Program members will receive beta testing versions of the software, in place of production versions, whenever a beta release is available.
