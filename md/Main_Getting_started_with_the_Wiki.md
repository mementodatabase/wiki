1. **Getting started** with the Memento Database *wiki*
This section provides the reader with an orientation to the wiki, at the end of which the reader should be able to understand how to freely & effectively make use of the wiki.

   1. Wikis
If you've used Wikipedia (www.wikipedia.org), you've used the software that's also used by Memento for its Wiki. It's called MediaWiki. It's the predominant implementation of the use of *hypertext* to document any universe of knowledge. This means Web pages containing information about topics named by their page titles, which are linked together and indexed for ready access by users. Users of Wikipedia will feel at home in the Wiki, though there are a few differences.

   1. The Wiki
The Wiki depends on the Main Page to index the user into the various parts of the Wiki. Searching the Wiki, though supported, is not well-suited for the Wiki, since the Wiki is under active development by the WikiTeam, which has yet-to-be-released pages and older, obsolete pages lying around, so searching the Wiki will result in quite a few extraneous results. You're welcome to try searching, if you like, but you may have to wade through the results a bit.

Most recently, the **banner menu** at the top of Wiki pages helps users to quickly navigate the Wiki when scrolling to the index to find the information you want is not necessary.

      1. Getting started with the Wiki
Keep in mind the 4 parts of the Main Page: the banner menu & page title, the introductory material, the indexes, and the supporting material.
- If you need support, select whether you want Wiki support or Memento support in the banner menu at the top of each page, or red at the bottom of the Main Page.
- If you are learning Memento, you might want to start at the beginning, read, and link around a bit.
- To go directly to a different part of the wiki, use the banner menu at the top of each page, including the Main Page.
- If you are seeking information now about the Memento application and its use, scroll through the appropriate index to find the topics you are interested in and the links related to those topics.
