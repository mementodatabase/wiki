title: "Memento Mobile Edition"
---

The Mobile Edition of Memento Database was developed first and is available only for Android platforms.

The visual presentation varies a bit depending upon the size and format of the device. A right-side menu may show only when swiped in from the right edge on a phone-sized device and may partially show all the time on a tablet-sized device, for example.

Also, certain functions cannot be carried out unless the device is a phone, like SMS messaging or call initiation. Location fields are in part dependent upon the presence of a GPS.

App integration depends upon the platform and the apps that are on it. **[Tasker integration](Tasker Integration.md)**, for instance, is specific to the Mobile Edition.

For release history, see **[Releases](Releases.md)**.
