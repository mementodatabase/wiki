1. The Memento Wiki
This wiki is under development. As such, it will just stop in some places, generally with [red links](red links.md) indicating pages yet to be written. You may also encounter pages that display an **"UNDER DEVELOPMENT"** message at the top. We recommend you wait until the message goes away before reading, as it might be erroneous.

While most aspects of Memento are common between the Mobile and Desktop editions, this wiki (generally) contains only information about the Mobile edition of Memento. Each page shows at the top of the page the version of the Mobile edition current as of the most recent change to the page. It also shows the version number of the Desktop edition current as of that date. Note the Help accessible within the app and from Help on the MementoDatabase.com Web site. Memento Help contains assistance for both the Mobile and Desktop editions.

An index to the pages of the wiki may be accessed via the following Index in the form of a table containing links to Wiki pages grouped vertically by topic and horizontally by the columns of Overviews, Specifications, Techniques, Tips, How, & Tutorials. Use the Index & wiki links throughout the wiki to navigate around among the pages of the wiki.

      1. Where do I start with Memento?

Stuff

   1. Other assistance
Unlike before the wiki, nowadays the Memento app has some Help within the app, developed by LuckyDroid. You can access it right next to where you access the wiki. The Help is oriented less for Power Users than the wiki and more for general users and beginners.

   1. Previous, obsolete documentation (erroneous & misleading)
''Previous Memento documentation has been subsumed within the wiki. It is listed here for reference, but its content has not been updated in quite a while and is not likely to be updated going forward.

Its content is now obsolete.
