title: "Library Groups"
---

All libraries are contained within *library groups*, by default, the group named My Libraries. Library groups have no intrinsic features; they are merely containers for libraries, offering assistance to users whose number of libraries is growing.

      1. Mobile Edition
Users may add groups via the 3-dot Action menu in the upper-right corner of the Library List screen.

Users may switch groups either by panning the screen right or left or via the 3-line Group/Main menu in the upper-left corner of the Library List screen.

      1. Desktop Edition
The My Libraries group is the only group and thus contains all libraries in the cloud.
