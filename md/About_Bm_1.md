***Bm 1* — Bill’s Jan 2023 memento** — Introduction to Bill’s mementos

I hope you’re having a happy 2023 so far! This is the first edition of my mementos — newsletters for the Memento forum about our use of Memento. They'll be published in my native American English as Memento Forum posts on a periodic basis (maybe every month or two). After a short introduction, one or more articles on the use of Memento will appear. Some of it will be topical commentary, but most will be articles intended to be informative & helpful to users who are trying to get the most out of Memento as they use it to do anything from making shopping lists to building database applications.

Sample search tags being considered...

- #dbDesign - Article discussing Memento database design

I tried to create an archive for *Bill's mementos* & their articles, and I've been mostly unsuccessful. Almost all my edits will not save without errors. I am working with the developer, whose server hosts the Memento Wiki, to rectify the situation. We'll have an archived set of *Bill's mementos as soon as is possible.*
