1. Memento Scripting index
Yada

When using Memento (or any software tool), one comes upon limits among the functions of what they can do. Most often these limits can be exceeded by the use of *scripting*.

Scripting is done for Memento in JavaScript, although there is an older, proprietary technique of scripting in Memento's calculation script. For information regarding such scripting, see [Calculation of expressions](About:Calculation of expressions.md) as an overview and [Calculation field](Spec:Calculation field.md) for details.
