      1. Sergio's photographic equipment email
I have a LOT of camera equipment (Camera, Lens, Filters, tripods, bags, etc.). I want to be able to create records of all of this equipment for personal inventory as well as insurance purposes.

So far, none of the prebuilt programs I have looked at covered all of the data that I wanted to track on a per item basis, so I decided to use this program, some research into existing templates and a lot of soul-searching to create my own me-friendly database. So far so good. I spent all day yesterday architecting  starting database. As will all programming, there will be further minor changes (new fields, verbiage tweaks, section grouping changes, etc.). That said, I am very happy with my initial go at this. 

So, in this bare bones example, I have a camera entry, a lens entry, and a filter entry.
In real life, ALL three of these items are physically part of the same "group/unit", The Lens is attached to the camera body and the filter is attached to that particular lens. 
While I still want to keep each item as their own separate record, I also want to link these 3 records together to visually show this relationship. And at some point, i want this grouping be part of a larger grouping (in a camera bag with other items for example).

      1. Example: Making a Shared library function available & call-in it from a trigger or action
| **From forum email** |

If you want to extend Memento with JavaScript, I suggest you read the wiki, so you can learn how to do it. If you want to use the simplest scripts, you could try using a JavaScript field, but it doesn't have fancy global functions like set() or link() or libByName(), but it does have simple global functions like field();

If you decide a usually simple JavaScript field is for you, read this page...
JavaScript field, or...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/JavaScript_field

If a fancy, probably longer script is what you feel you need, read this page, for starters, since all the other stuff is based on: Memento Javascript Library, or...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/Memento_JavaScript_Library

If you're going for the fancier stuff & have read the MJL page, you can then branch out into various directions, depending on what you want to do next...

 * For a button in the libraries list screen or a button in an edit view card (assuming mobile Memento): Actions, or...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/Actions

 * For a script to run automatically when certain things happen in certain circumstances: Triggers, or...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/Triggers, or...

...and...
Trigger examples: Trigger examples, or...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/Trigger_examples

The rest of the MJL-based JavaScript pages are for other, less-often-used scripts...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/Data_Sources, or...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/How:Write_scripts_in_JavaScript_for_Memento, or...
https://wiki.mementodatabase.com/index.php/Tips:Using_JavaScript_in_Memento
|  |
For a shared function definition, it should be...
```

function sub(fieldname, fieldvalue) {
    entry().set(fieldName, fieldValue);
}

```
Then call that in a trigger, action, or whatever with this...
```

sub("name", "bullet");

```

We know only what we can glean ... That there is a field named "name" and a value "bullet" that you want to go into that field. If it's a shared script, why does it call a global function field()? There is no such global function. There must be a "current entry" for that, and shared scripts (like most other things) don't work for JavaScript fields.

If you tell us more, we can be of more help, but all I can do is guess that the following is what you want...

It must be a trigger script or an action script located in an entry. This enables the entry() global function to work, so there is a "current" entry.

So, ` entry().set("name", "bullet"); ` is all the script you need, if your objective is to set that field's value to "button". If you're wanting to do something else, you might consider telling what that is.
