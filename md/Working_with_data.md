1. Working with data
Merriam-Webster defines the word “data” in several ways, but the main definition that applies here for the Memento Database Desktop edition is that “data” is defined as facts or information used usually to calculate, analyze, or plan something. For example, let us say one creates a library to store medical records and information about his/her health.  The accumulated data, once analyzed, now leads to the creation of a health plan. 

Working with data is like being a detective, or a researcher.  This means that you should consider carefully what questions you need to answer even before you acquire your data.  Thus, what questions would one want answered in his/her medical library?  It is highly recommended that the first thing one should do is create a plan on paper, an outline or blueprint, if you will, of what data you wish to acquire in your library database.  See here for an example of a blueprint (**Note:** This example is for the Mobile Edition but the concept is the same for the Desktop Edition)
