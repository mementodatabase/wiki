title: "Entry Edit card"
---

The Entry Edit card displays the names & values of the fields of the current or selected entry, with the values in blanks for editing.

The parts of the Entry Edit card are:

   1. Card Header bar
At the top of the card is the Header bar.

      1. Save & Exit button
At the leftmost edge of the bar is the Save & Exit (checkmark) button. Touching it saves the current values of the field and exits the card back to the underlying screen, normally the Entries List screen.

      1. Card title
The center portion of the bar contains the Card Title, which is **Edit entry**.

      1. Card/Screen button
Toward the right edge of the bar is the Card/Screen button; The button icon had the shape of a square made up of 4 tiny inward-facing our outward-facing arrows.

When the arrows face in, the card is displayed as a full screen, and pressing the button changes the display to that of a card, covering only a portion of the underlying screen &mdash; normally, the Entries List screen.

When the arrows face out, the card is now displayed as a card, and pressing the button changes the display to that of a full screen.

      1. Action Menu
At the far right of the Header bar is the Action (3-dot) menu button. When pressed, the following option is listed:

**Cancel** — The Cancel option is displayed. Selecting this option causes any changes to field values to be abandoned, and control will return to the underlying screen, normally the Entries List screen.

   1. Card Body
The body of the card is used to display fields and their values.

      1. Page tabs
If additional pages have been added to the library, there will be a row of tabs at the top of the card body, one for each page &mdash; MAIN and those that have been added. If no additional pages have been added, there will be no tab row, but the MAIN page will be displayed.

      1. Subheader dividers
If one or more subheaders have been added to the library page being viewed, each will provide a horizontal divider to break the display of fields into sections.

      1. Fields and their values
The fields of the current page are displayed in the order in which they are defined.

Normally, each field is displayed on its own row. Each field's name is displayed at the top of the row left-justified, with its value displayed &mdasg; In the case of single-valued fields &mdash;below that, also left-justified. Field values are displayed in Edit mode, ready to be altered.

If a field's setting **One row with prev** is set on, it will be displayed to the right and, if possible, on the same row as the previous field. If that isn't possible (because the previous field was itself a **One row with prev** field), it will be displayed on the right and on the row below the previous field.

Each page will scroll as needed, and the user will tap tabs as needed to switch between pages.
